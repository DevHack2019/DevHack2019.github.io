						Nowadays, people are so caught up in their lives, with their work and personal commitments, leaving them very little time to think of their personal health. Clearly, the age-old connotation that health is wealth has not been realized as people still prefer solely thinking about placements rather than devoting an equal amount of time for hitting the gym. Your challenge is to come up with everyday hacks, right from machines to a digital aid, that could remind them of their true wealth and help them regain shape.
